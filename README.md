# AdaptiveCV: AI-powered Resume Generation and Optimization

## Overview
AdaptiveCV is an advanced, AI-driven platform designed to automatically generate and optimize resumes tailored specifically for individual job descriptions. Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), AdaptiveCV helps job seekers efficiently create high-quality, recruiter-friendly, and Applicant Tracking System (ATS) optimized resumes, significantly increasing interview opportunities.

## Problem Statement
Creating job-specific resumes increases interview chances but remains an impractical task due to its time-consuming nature. Traditional methods of resume tailoring are either manual and resource-intensive or rely on simplistic keyword matching and static templates, failing to dynamically adjust to unique job requirements.

AdaptiveCV addresses this challenge by providing a fully automated, intelligent resume generation and optimization solution that dynamically tailors content to specific job descriptions.

## Features
AdaptiveCV operates in two primary modes:
- **Resume Generation Mode**: Users input their personal background and professional details, and AdaptiveCV generates a structured resume optimized for the target job description.
- **Resume Optimization Mode**: Users upload an existing resume, and AdaptiveCV intelligently optimizes it to increase compatibility with recruiter expectations and ATS filtering criteria.

### Workflow
The workflow of AdaptiveCV consists of:
- **User Input**: Input personal details or existing resumes.
- **Data Aggregation**: Consolidates user input and extracted job requirements.
- **LLM Processing**: Dynamically generates content aligned with the job description.
- **Web Interface**: Allows users to interactively refine the generated resume.

### Core System Pipeline
- **Job Description Parsing**: Extracts essential qualifications, skills, and keywords.
- **User Resume Processing**: Analyzes uploaded resumes or inputted details.
- **Resume Generation and Optimization**: Produces structured, targeted resumes to optimize ATS compatibility and recruiter appeal.

### Datasets and Preprocessing
- **Datasets**: Utilizes publicly available datasets of resumes and job postings.
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Text Cleaning
  - Tokenization
  - Entity Extraction (skills, qualifications, etc.)

## Evaluation Metrics
The effectiveness of AdaptiveCV will be measured through:
- **Job Alignment Score**: Evaluates the match between the resume and job requirements (keyword coverage and semantic similarity).
- **Content Preservation Score**: Ensures factual accuracy, avoiding misrepresentation or hallucination by the LLM.

## Usage
### User Workflow
1. Enter personal details or upload an existing resume.
2. Provide or select a target job description.
3. Generate an optimized resume.
4. Refine interactively if necessary.
5. Download the final resume.

## Benefits
- Significantly reduces time and effort spent on manual resume tailoring.
- Enhances ATS compatibility through intelligent keyword optimization.
- Improves recruiter attraction by precisely aligning resume content with job requirements.

## Limitations and Future Work
- Currently reliant on the quality of user input and accuracy of job parsing.
- Further evaluation with real-world scenarios is needed to strengthen generalizability.
- Exploration of integration with other recruitment platforms and systems.

## Future Directions
- Incorporation of user feedback loops for continuous model improvement.
- Expansion of datasets for broader and more robust training.
- Introduction of multilingual support to accommodate global job seekers.

## Conclusion
AdaptiveCV offers a practical, scalable solution that intelligently automates resume creation and optimization, effectively enhancing users' chances of securing interviews by aligning resumes closely with job-specific requirements.
