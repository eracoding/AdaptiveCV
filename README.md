# AdaptiveCV: AI-powered Resume Generation and Optimization

## Overview
AdaptiveCV is an advanced AI-driven platform designed to automatically generate, optimize, and personalize resumes tailored to specific job descriptions.Leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), AdaptiveCV helps job seekers create high-quality, ATS-friendly, and recruiter-optimized resumes â€” significantly increasing interview opportunities with minimal manual effort.

## Problem Statement
Creating job-specific resumes increases interview chances but remains an impractical task due to its time-consuming nature. Traditional methods of resume tailoring are either manual and resource-intensive or rely on simplistic keyword matching and static templates, failing to dynamically adjust to unique job requirements.

AdaptiveCV addresses this challenge by providing a fully automated, intelligent resume generation and optimization solution that dynamically tailors content to specific job descriptions.

## Features
1. Resume Generation: Create a brand-new, structured resume aligned with a specific job description based on user input or uploaded data.
2. Resume Optimization: Upload an existing resume and intelligently improve it to match recruiter expectations and ATS standards.
3. Resume Metrics: Evaluate resume effectiveness based on personalization, job alignment, and original match scores.
4. Interactive Web App: Easy-to-use Streamlit-based UI to generate, download, edit in Overleaf, and analyze resumes.

### Workflow:
1. **User Input**: Upload resume or enter professional details.
2. **Job Parsing**: Extract key skills and requirements from job descriptions.
3. **Data Aggregation**: Combine user data and job info.
4. **LLM Processing**: Generate or optimize resumes aligned to the job.
5. **Web Interface**: Download, edit, and evaluate resume content.

---

### Core System Pipeline
- **Job Description Parsing**: Extracts essential qualifications, skills, and keywords.
- **User Resume Processing**: Analyzes uploaded resumes or inputted details.
- **Resume Generation and Optimization**: Produces structured, targeted resumes to optimize ATS compatibility and recruiter appeal.

### Datasets and Preprocessing
- **Datasets**: Utilizes publicly available datasets of resumes and job postings.
- **Preprocessing Steps**:
  - Text Cleaning
  - Tokenization
  - Entity Extraction (skills, qualifications, etc.)

## Evaluation Metrics
The effectiveness of AdaptiveCV will be measured through:
- **Job Alignment Score**: Evaluates the match between the resume and job requirements (keyword coverage and semantic similarity).
- **Content Preservation Score**: Ensures factual accuracy, avoiding misrepresentation or hallucination by the LLM.

## Usage

### Quick Start Example:
```bash
poetry install
poetry run python main.py --job-url "link/to/job_posting" --user-data "src/demo/user_profile.json/pdf"
```

Or use the **Streamlit App**:
```bash
poetry run streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

---

### User Workflow
1. Enter personal details manually or upload an existing resume file.
2. Provide or select a target job description.
3. Generate a resume tailored to the job.
4. Review resume effectiveness metrics.
5. Download the final resume or edit further in Overleaf.

## Benefits
- **Save time** and automate resume tailoring.
- **Optimize ATS compatibility** for better visibility.
- **Increase recruiter interest** through dynamic content alignment.
- **Interactive editing** and visualization for users.

## Limitations and Future Work
- Dependent on the quality of user input and job description parsing accuracy.
- Future improvements could include:
  - Real-world dataset fine-tuning.
  - Multilingual support.
  - Direct integration with job boards and recruitment platforms.
  - Continuous learning from user feedback loops.
